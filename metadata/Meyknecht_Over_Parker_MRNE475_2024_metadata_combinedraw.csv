Study: Temperature-Induced Shifts in Chemosensory Responses of Hermissenda crassicornis to Predator and Conspecific Cues,,,,
"Course: BMSC Fall Program 2024, Directed Studies (MRSC 507, MRNE 400)",,,,
Group: nudi_reactors,,,,
"Members: Brianna Over, Fiona Parker and Luca Meyknecht",,,,

Methods:,"Specimens were placed in a long container with a grid where they were allowed to react to chemical cues, they were recorded during this",,,
,trial time. Data from the trial period in nudi_treatmentdata and in nudi_vids. Footage was then analyed in Image J and recorded data,,,
,"can be found in pred_trials, cons_trials and nudi_size.",,,
,,,,
Column,Data type,Description,,Units
mean_angle,number,the average angle a nudibanch moved over its trial fromits starting point,,degrees (°)
sd_angle,number,"the standard deviation, of the mean angle",,degrees (°)
mean_vel,number,mean velocity a nudibranch traveled over its trial period,,meters per second (m/s)
sd_vel,number,the standard deviation of the mean velocity,,meters per second (m/s)
direction_binom,integer,a binomial that describes if the nudi moved towards (1) or away (0) from the cue,,
