Study: Temperature-Induced Shifts in Chemosensory Responses of Hermissenda crassicornis to Predator and Conspecific Cues,,,,,,
"Course: BMSC Fall Program 2024, Directed Studies (MRSC 507, MRNE 400)",,,,,,
Group: nudi_reactors,,,,,,

Methods:,"Specimens were placed in a long container with a grid where they were allowed to react to chemical cues, they were recorded during this",,,,,
,trial time. Data from the trial period in nudi_treatmentdata and in nudi_vids. Footage was then analyed in Image J and recorded data,,,,,
,"can be found in pred_trials, cons_trials and nudi_size.",,,,,
